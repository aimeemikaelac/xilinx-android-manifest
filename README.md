# xilinx-android-manifest
This is the manifest for my forked version of the Xilinx-sponsored Android OS developed by Iveia. Since they have
shut down their repositories for the port of gingerbread to the zc702 and the current port of Android that Iveia
has created does not boot, I have pushed the locally cloned versions of Android that I had before.

I need a version of Android that boots on the Zedboard, btu since Iveia has deleted it for whatever reason, I must
put it here. It may prove useful to others as well.

For reference, the link to the old manifest git repository is: git://git.iveia.com/scm/xilinx/android/platofrm/manifest.git

Instructions for building this version of Android for the Zedboard are available at: http://elinux.org/Zedboard_Android
Just replace the Iveia git URLs with URLs from these repositories, mainly the manifest repository URL. Everything esle should
work unmodified.
